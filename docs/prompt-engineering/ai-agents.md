# AI Agents

## Introduction to AI Agents

AI Agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC), AI agents can assist with various tasks from design optimization to project management.
## Types of AI Agents

### Reactive Agents
Simple agents that respond to immediate stimuli without considering history or future implications.

### Planning Agents  
Agents that can formulate plans to achieve goals, considering multiple steps and potential obstacles.

### Learning Agents
Agents that improve their performance over time through experience and feedback.

## Applications in AEC

AI agents can be applied in various domains within architecture, engineering, and construction:

- **Design Assistance**: Automated space planning and layout optimization
- **Project Management**: Resource allocation and scheduling optimization  
- **Quality Control**: Automated inspection and compliance checking
- **Facility Management**: Predictive maintenance and energy optimization

## Getting Started

To begin working with AI agents in your projects, consider starting with simple rule-based systems before advancing to more complex machine learning approaches.
